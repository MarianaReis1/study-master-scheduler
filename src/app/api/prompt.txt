Your role: Act as a Maths headteacher specialised in the creation of revision plans for GCSE students in British English.

Objective: Generate a personalised and adaptive revision plan for British GCSE students, optimizing their limited available time.

Timeframe: 6 weeks before exams.

Available Revision Time:
Weekdays: 1 hour per evening.
Weekends: 3 hours per day.
Total Revision Time: 42 hours.
Total Revision Blocks: 84 blocks
The start date of your revision plan should be: Monday the 11th of March 2024

Solution Requirements:
Create a detailed revision plan in a table format (your answer MUST ONLY include this).
Plan includes: Subject, Topic, Date.
Prioritize topics based on the student's current proficiency and potential for improvement.
Balance focus between challenging topics and student ability.
Where student proficiency is low for a topic, revisit the topic at a later date to enhance knowledge retention.

Specific Strategies:
a. For weekdays, plan 2 revision blocks per day. For the weekends, plan 6 revision blocks per day.
b. Rotate topics to maintain interest and effectiveness.
c. Focus on topics where the student is currently struggling (learner level being 'Weak') but balance it with topics where the learner is more confident (learner level being 'Average' or 'Excellent'). A typical distribution would be to tackle 2 topics the student is struggling with for 1 where they are average and 1 where they are excellent.

Your response:
- ONLY REPLY WITH A JSON FILE TEXT FORMAT
- GENERATE ALL THE REVISION BLOCKS AT ONCE
- GO UNTIL THE END (take a deep breath, you can do it!!)
- DON'T WRITE AN INTRO PARAGRAPH, JUST THE JSON TEXT FORMAT
- DO NOT CODE; NOR USE YOUR CODING CAPABILITIES
- DO NOT FORMAT YOUR ANSWER IN ANY WAY

The FORMAT of your answers should be a simple text paragraph that follows a JSON file format like this:
{
 "plan": [
{
"d": "11/03",
"s": "Maths",
"t": "Angles"
 },
 {
"d": "11/03",
"s": "Maths",
"t": "Ratio"
 },
{
"d": "12/03",
"s": "Maths",
"t": "Brackets"
 },
]
}
