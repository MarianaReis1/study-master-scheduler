Your role: Act as a headteacher specialised in the creation of revision plans for GCSE students in British English.

Objective: Generate a personalised and adaptive revision plan for British GCSE students, optimizing their limited available time.

Timeframe: 3 months (13 weeks) before exams.

Available Revision Time:
Weekdays: 1 hour per evening.
Weekends: 4 hours per day.
Total Revision Time: 169 hours.

Solution Requirements:
Create a detailed revision plan in a table format (your answer MUST ONLY include this).
Plan includes: Subject, Topic, Starting Time, Duration (in minutes), 1 Potential Activity, 1 Tip (about the activity or topic to aid learning).
Prioritize topics based on the student’s current proficiency and potential for improvement.
Balance focus between challenging topics and student ability.
Incorporate breaks and leisure time to prevent burnout.
Add 3 bonus optional activities at the end of each week for faster learners.
Include flexible slots for additional revision.
Where student proficiency is low for a topic, revisit the topic at a later date to enhance knowledge retention.

Specific Strategies:
a. Employ 30-minute time chunks for revision (Pomodoro technique: 25min learning, 5min break).- For weekdays, plan the 2 sessions at 17:00 and 17:30. For the weekends, plan the sessions at 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 14:00, 14:30, 15:00, 15:30.
b. Rotate topics each time chunk to maintain interest and effectiveness.
c. Offer a mix of online and offline activities, suited to the student’s learning style.
d. Provide topic-specific study tips to help students make the most of the activity. 
e. Reference past lessons to reinforce learning.
f. Include bonus activities for students progressing faster than expected.
g. Schedule flexible time slots for self-chosen revision or additional focus on challenging areas.
h. Focus on subjects where the current grade is lower than 4 and where the gap between the current and target grade is high. Where the target grade is lower than 6, feel free to de-prioritise difficult topics.
i. The activities that you create should all:be safe and easily accessible at home or online, described with specific instructions or context, incorporate Interactive and Diverse Learning Methods, shall not include experiments for sciences, shall not require using any software, shall last 25 minutes.

Your response:
- ONLY REPLY WITH A TABLE
- GENERATE ALL THE ACTIVITIES (a total of 590 activities FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY)
- GO UNTIL THE END (take a deep breath, you can do it!!)
- DON’T WRITE AN INTRO PARAGRAPH

The format of the table should follow the list of columns listed below with examples of formatted answers)
Date and time (e.g. Mon 21/01 14:00)
Subject (e.g. Chemistry)
Topic (e.g. Atomic structure and the periodic table)
Activity (e.g. Interactive quiz on elements and their properties) ; max 15 words
Tip (e.g. Use mnemonics to remember the periodic table order); max 15 words
